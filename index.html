                        Computer programming is the practice of writing code to instruct computers to perform tasks, using languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++. Beginners should focus on learning basic concepts like variables, loops, and functions, while working on small projects to build practical skills. Understanding different programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, helps in choosing the right approach for various types of problems.

                        Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications, divided into frontend (what users see) and backend (the server-side functionality), with full-stack development combining both. Essential technologies in 2024 include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Node.js, and APIs for building dynamic, interactive websites. The path to becoming a web developer involves learning these basics, choosing a focus area, building projects, and staying updated with industry trends like Web3, Progressive Web Apps, and AI-driven tools.

            <p>I am a 20 year old Applied Chemidtry and Computer Science Major. I am doing this course because web-devlopment and game-devlopment are things I am passionate about. I think web-devlopment is facinating because of how defferent and unique web pages can be.</p>
